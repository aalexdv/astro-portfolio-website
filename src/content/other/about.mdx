Hi, I'm a technology enthusiast with a passion for engineering, AI/ML, and data science. I have years of experience in IT and Digital Marketing, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge with a Master's degree in Computer Science. 

Outside of the digital world, you'll find me exploring audio and acoustical engineering, or staying active through sports and travel.
